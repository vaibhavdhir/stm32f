# stm32f
tweaking various hardware components using the stm32 microcontroller
here i am planning to configure the stm32 microcontroller to perform a few functions and the model first used is stm32f103c8t6
i do plan to work with a more cost friendly device such as the stm32f030f4 soon too
my first project was essentially to configure the p10 chinese display often seen in public transport and subway/metro systems
